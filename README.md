# Hi there 👋  
I am Shaun — a Business Analyst and developer with a strong interest in logic, language, and intelligent systems.

## 🛠️ What I am working on

### 🧠 Phink — a web-based vectorised knowledge network that explores structured meaning and relationships between concepts.  
Using Python, spaCy, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, Node.js, and Solid.js to build a fully integrated pipeline for parsing, seeding, and querying structured content enhanced by AI models.

### 🧪 Dabbling with logic implementations using discrete mathematics.

## 📖 Currently learning

### 🔬 The IBM Data Science Professional Certificate  
To round out my formal grounding in data science and applied machine learning.
